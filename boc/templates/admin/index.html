    <h1>Guide to Admin View</h1>
    <h3>General Structure</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>list view: displays the data and allows edits and
            deletions using the pencil and trash can icon on
            the leftmost part of the table
        </li>
        <li>create view: shows a form with the necessary fields
            to fill in to create a new entry into the table the tab
            is dedicated to
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Features</h3>
    <h4>Admin</h4>
    <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b><br><br>You can grant more people access to admin view by
        adding their email to the table using the create tab.
        You can also decide their clearance (e.g. if they can only view, or if they can also edit and
        delete, etc.)
    </p>
    <h4>Users</h4>
    <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b><br><br>Clicking the reset weights button
        <button type='submit'>Reset All Weights</button>
        will reset all users' weights to the default value
        of 1.0. Use this button at the end of each semester, or whenver you want to reset the weights
        for the lottery. <br><br>When creating a new
        user, the Auth ID field is the ID associated with the user used by the third party verification
        service Auth0; you do not have to fill
        it out if you wish to manually create a new user. Keep in mind, all users who register through
        Auth0 (clicking sign up when logging in)
        will be logged in the table automatically.
    </p>
    <h4>Trips</h4>
    <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b><br><br>The run lottery column will display a button <strong>only
        after</strong> the signup deadline has passed for the trip.
        Click the button
        <button type='submit'>Run</button>
        to run the lottery and automatically send emails to those who won a spot.
        After lottery is run, the lottery field in the response table will be
        updated to true or false depending on if the user was awarded a spot.
        The waitlist table will also be updated with the order for who is next in line for trip spots
    </p>
    Troubleshooting:
    <ul>
        <li>When creating a trip, input dates by clicking the input field and then using the calendar
            pop up
            instead of manually typing. If the calendar is filled with NaN, type a number and it should
            go
            back to valid dates.
        </li>
        <li>When inputting trip leaders, input names separated by commas.</li>
        <li>Input images by getting the image url and pasting it in.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Responses</h4>
    <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b><br><br>When a user is awarded a spot, as indicated by the
        lottery_spot field, you can
        update the user behavior field to match how the user responds to the offer (e.g. <select
                id="behavior" name="behavior">
            <option value="Confirmed">Confirmed</option>
            <option value="Declined">Declined</option>
            <option value="No Response">No Response</option>
        </select>).
        This updates the user weights accordingly.
    </p>
    <h4>Waitlist</h4>
    <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b><br><br>Allows you to give the user up next on the waitlist a
        spot on the trip by clicking
        the button
        <button type='submit'>Move Off Waitlist</button>
        found under Award Trip Spot. This updates the userâ€™s lottery status in the response table and
        moves
        the rest of the waitlist up one in standing. If you seek to move someone who isn't the first up
        on the waitlist,
        you would need to edit the waitlist rank fields of two rows (edit the one you want to move off
        the waitlist to
        have a rank of 1, and edit the row you want to swap rankings with to have this row's old rank)
        in order to not
        break the code. If the number of people who have been awarded spots (who have confirmed or have
        yet to respond)
        is max capacity, you will not be able to move someone off the waitlist.
    </p>
