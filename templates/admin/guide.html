            <ul>
                <li>list view: displays the data and allows edits and 
                    deletions using the pencil and trash can icon on 
                    the leftmost part of the table</li>
                <li>create view: shows a form with the necessary fields 
                    to fill in to create a new entry into the table the tab 
                    is dedicated to</li>

                <h4>Admin</h4>
                <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b> You can grant more people access to admin view by adding their email to the table using the create tab. 
                    You can also decide their clearance (e.g. if they can only view, or if they can also edit and delete, etc.)
                </p>

                <h4>Users</h4>
                <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b> Clicking the reset weights button will reset all users' weights to the default value 
                    of 1.0. Use this button at the end of each semester, or whenver you want to reset the weights for the lottery.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "section">
                <h4>Trips</h4>
                <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b> The run lottery column will display a button after the signup deadline has passed for the trip. 
                    Click the button to run the lottery and automatically send emails to those who won a spot.
                    After lottery is run, the lottery field in the response table will be 
                    updated to true or false depending on if the user was awarded a spot. 
                    The waitlist table will also be updated with the order for who is next in line for trip spots</p>
                <ul>
                    Troubleshooting:
                    <li>When creating a trip, input dates by clicking the input field and then using the calendar pop up 
                        instead of manually typing. If the calendar is filled with NaN, type a number and it should go 
                        back to valid dates.</li>
                    <li>Input images by getting the image url and pasting it in.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class = "section">
                <h4>Responses</h4>
                <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b> When a user is awarded a spot, as indicated by the lottery_spot field, you can 
                    update the user behavior field to match how the user responds to the offer (eg if the user is a no show, declines). 
                    This updates the user weights accordingly.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "section">
                <h4>Waitlist</h4>
                <p><b> Overview of functionality:</b> Allows you to give the user up next on the waitlist a spot on the trip by clicking 
                    the button under Award Trip Spot. This updates the userâ€™s lottery status in the response table and moves 
                    the rest of the waitlist up one in standing. If you seek to move someone who isn't the first up on the waitlist, 
                    you would need to edit the waitlist rank fields of two rows (edit the one you want to move off the waitlist to 
                    have a rank of 1, and edit the row you want to swap rankings with to have this row's old rank) in order to not 
                    break the code. If the number of people who have been awarded spots (who have confirmed or have yet to respond) 
                    is max capacity, you will not be able to move someone off the waitlist.</p>
